# Platformer
Just some small platform game made in sdl3 and c and if i figure out how to use box2d maybe ill add it too




It makes use of sdl3 to display objects 
c for the logic , though ill probably use cpp in the future ( but i dont know cpp )


some stuufs that ill implement in the near future 

-- camera 

-- colission detection 

-- wasd keyboard movements 

-- an actual playable map 

THATS IT FOR NOW G
