# Downfall 
Just some small platform game made in sdl3 and c and if i figure out how to use box2d maybe ill add it too




It makes use of sdl3 to display objects 
c for the logic , though ill probably use cpp in the future ( but i dont know cpp )


some stuufs that ill implement in the near future 

-- camera // i did it , but the camera needs a lot work and im really nitpicky about it

-- colission detection 

-- wasd keyboard movements // i did it

-- an actual playable map // kinda

THATS IT FOR NOW G
